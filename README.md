# antle
2D ant colony simulator in Java

The goal is to create a nice simple platform for people to design their own AI for the ants. The game could be multiplayer, with both players choosing an AI and configuring it on the fly.

One hope is to learn more about collective thinking and see the more simple patterns, so this understanding can be applied to learn about humans interacting over the internet.
